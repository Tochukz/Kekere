## Kekere 
Kekere is a light weight, minimal PHP MVC framework build for simplicity. Built primarily for fun and learning but can be used for small projects.
The framework follows many of [Laravel's](http://laravel.com) convention and has a similar directory structure to [ASP.NET MVC](http://asp.net/mvc). 
Kekere is built for simple projects that requires some sort of MVC structure and elegance that an MVC application offers while still maintaining a minimal foot print, hence the framework is stand alone having no dependency or vendor folder.
The basic features of an MVC application is implemented in a simple way. Some of the features include:      
* Simple and elegant implementation of the MVC architecture
* Easy defination of models
* Easy interaction with database with or without defining a model
* Built-in view engine 
* Built in database migration
* Built in seeder
* Extendable CLI component

Kekere is still in the development stages but it already have a working harkable base.
